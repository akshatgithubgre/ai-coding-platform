What is feature scaling?,"Feature scaling is a preprocessing technique in machine learning that transforms the numerical features of a dataset to a similar scale, ensuring that all features contribute equally to the model's training and performance. ",1,hard
What is reinforcement learning?,Reinforcement learning (RL) is a machine learning technique that teaches software to make decisions that maximize rewards. It's a way for software to learn to perform a task without being explicitly programmed. ,1,hard

How do you detect overfitting?,i forgot this one too,0,medium
What is hyperparameter tuning?,i forgot,0,easy
What is gradient descent?,"Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used in machine learning to find the minimum of a function, often a cost or loss function, by repeatedly moving in the direction of the steepest descent of the function. ",1,medium
What is a label in supervised learning?,"In supervised learning, a label is the ""answer"" or the desired output that a model is trained to predict based on input features. ",1,hard
What is feature scaling?,"Features scaling and machine learning is a crucial pre-processing step that transforms  numerical features to a similar scale, ensuring all features contribute equally to the models  performance, especially for algorithms sensitive to data scale.",1,hard
What is a label in supervised learning?,"Datasets are made up of individual examples that contain features and a label. You could think of an example as analogous to a single row in a spreadsheet. Features are the values that a supervised model uses to predict the label. The label is the ""answer,"" or the value we want the model to predict",1,hard
What are the best practices for deploying ML models?,"To successfully deploy ML models, focus on establishing clear processes, using appropriate tools, ensuring model validation and version control, and implementing robust monitoring and maintenance strategies. ",1,hard
Explain regularization techniques in ML.,Regularization in machine learning is a set of techniques used to ensure that a machine learning model can generalize to new data within the same data set. These techniques can help reduce the impact of noisy data that falls outside the expected range of patterns,1,Intro
What is a model in machine learning?,"In machine learning, a ""model"" is a trained algorithm or program that can recognize patterns or make predictions based on data it has learned from. It's essentially a representation of the relationships within data, enabling the system to make inferences or decisions on new, unseen data. ",1,Mechanism
Explain PCA (Principal Component Analysis).,Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique that summarizes large data sets by identifying new axes that capture the most variation in the data. This process is called dimensionality reduction. ,1,Mechanism
What is gradient descent?,Gradient descent is a mathematical algorithm that finds the minimum of a function by repeatedly adjusting its parameters. It's a common tool for training machine learning models and neural networks. ,1,Mechanism
How does Naive Bayes classifier work?,"Naive Bayes classifiers are probabilistic classifiers based on Bayes' theorem, assuming that each feature is independent of others, simplifying computations and making them computationally efficient. ",1,Mechanism
Explain linear regression.,"Linear Regression Explained | Towards Data ScienceLinear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables, by finding the ""best-fit"" straight line (or plane in multiple dimensions) through a set of data points. ",1,Mechanism
Describe logistic regression.,"Logistic regression is a statistical method used for predicting a binary outcome (yes/no, 0/1) based on independent variables by estimating the probability of an event occurring. ",1,Mechanism
